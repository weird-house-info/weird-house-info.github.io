  <h2>Sorting Hat on a 19th-century weird house? Yes! ^_^</h2>
  <i>Adopted from <a href="https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/86000263_text">National Register of Historic Places Inventory</a></i>

  <p>
    The Pythian Castle is an excellent example of commercial Queen Anne architecture. Prominent among the century-old building's exterior features are the five towers: three round-corner ones with “witches hats"
    and two square bays in the centers of the street-side walls.

    <i>Sorting Hat character shares a lot of similarities with the tower roofs.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    Curved brackets line the vertical-board cornice on the street sides: colonettes, pointed pediments, and brackets decorate the windows in the towers, and broken pediments top two pairs of windows in the south wall. The building  has recently  undergone  major restoration/renovation work.

    <i>Exterior alterations are confined to ground-level changes in doors and windows.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    Interior remodeling is extensive. However, intrusive exterior alterations have been
    corrected and interior work retained as many original features as possible. Located  on a
    busy  corner  just  two blocks north  of  Arcata's  downtown Plaza, the Pythian Castle is the
    community's  most notable 19th-century  commercial building.

    The Pythian Castle is a two-story  building  of  wood construction  with  2,880  square feet  on
    each floor. The steps  and deck on the south side  cover  640 square feet,  and the north-side
    stairs from the upper floor total 148 square feet. Located on a corner two blocks north  of
    Arcata's Plaza, the  building is in  an area  of  mixed architectural styles  and periods. Newer
    buildings and parking  areas occupy the other  three  corners  of  the intersection, but  within
    the same block as the Pythian  Castle  are settlement-period houses, a Victorian,  and
    two turn-of-the-century  houses.

  </p>

  <p>
    The building's Queen Anne architecture is dominated by five  projecting  towers. Three
    round-corner towers contain five  windows and are topped by "witches  hats"  that  in  times past
    sprouted tall finials. The  two center-wall towers  are square bays  with four  windows  and
    truncated  hip tops, once highlighted  by  cresting. Patterned shingles  covered the tower roofs
    in  the  early  days.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bays  are decorated with triangular  pediments, colonettes, and
    brackets. A  vertical-board  cornice  along the east  and south walls is  marked by  a line  of
    curved brackets. Two pairs  of  upper-story  windows on the south wall are covered by  broken
    pediments.
